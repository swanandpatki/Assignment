yes I think you might be correct. If you still have the modules, you can re-upload them and see if that clears the error.

I'd like to suggest also to begin making backups of your work periodically, so that you'll have something to use in cases such as this.





2.This happened again doing same thats why third time i didnt changed connection mode.

3.Because of this issues I was not able to change any template of theme to override design
